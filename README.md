# Non-Endemic Segmentations
Segmentations (aka audiences) are sets of households that can be marketed to via the Prism platform. Non-endemic segmentations are segmentations that are in-demand by Kroger's non-endemic clients. Some examples of non-endemic segmentations are:
* Households that purchase infant products.
* Households that purchase dog products.
* Households that purchase vegetarian products.
* Households that live in a metropolitan area.
* Households that purchase high quality goods.
