# Non-Endemic Segmentations
Segmentations (aka audiences) are sets of households that can be marketed to via the Prism platform. Non-endemic segmentations are segmentations that are in-demand by 84.51's non-endemic clients. Some examples of segmentations are:
* **Vegan Product Enthusiasts** - Buyers that prefer to purchase vegan brands and products based on purchase history and shopping patterns.
* Back-to-School Product Shoppers - Buyers who have a high affinity for purchasing academic themed products and products during the Fall and back to school category timeframe.
* High Volume Fuel Fillers - Buyers that purchase high volumes of fuel within the past 52 weeks. Fuel types are not distinguished for this audience.
* Road Trippers - Buyers who are frequently found shopping and/or filling up gas at stores outside of their preferred store and those stores are a significant distance away from their preferred store. In a nutshell, households that go on road trips or travel frequently.
