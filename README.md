# Commodity-Segmentations
This process creates sets of UPCs that define non-endemic segmentations in the Prism Audience Library. This process relies on a control file that specifies which commodities and sub-commodities for each segmentation. The commodities and sub-commodities were chosen based how relevant they are to the given segment.
